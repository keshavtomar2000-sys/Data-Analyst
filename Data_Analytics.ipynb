        "\n",
        "- The role of Data Analyst is to collect the data and than filter out the unorganized data into a meaningful one and after that it gives you the insights of the data which helps the companies to make the right decissions for their organization in order to generate the profit for the companies, So this is the role of a data analyst.\n",
        "\n",

        "- The three main tools used by data analyst are-:\n",
        "\n",
        "EXCEL- It is one of the most important and practiced tool in data analyst field it helps in cleaning Data, and helps in creating the reports, and also helps in creating the pivot tables, the Excel is the widely used tools in data analyst.\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL- The SQL used in Filterng, grouping and and cleaning the details, most it is used for removing the duplicates, handling the missing valuesand it also helps in pull out the data from data base, and the Fullform of SQL is (Structured Query Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "Power BI- The main use of Power BI is Data Visualization and dashboard creation and it also helps in making decission from the interactive charts and reports.\n",

        "\n",
        "(I) Define the Business Problem-\n",
        "\n",
        "First We need to find what is the problem we need to clarify our objectives like what we need in order to make our bsuiness run smoothly, we need to indentify the problems in the business whether it is regarded with the sales of the product or whether it clould be why we are not able to get more profit from the product.\n",
        "\n",
        "(II) Collect the Data-\n",

        "\n",
        "(III) Clean and prepare The Data-\n",
        "\n",
        "This is one of the most important step in this workflow in order to move to any decission we need the data clean by using different tools like SQL, Python (Pndas) R.\n",
        "\n",
        "(IV) Explore and Analyze Data-\n",
        "\n",
        "After get cleaned data we need to analyze the Data to uncover the trends, Ptterns and understand the data story for that we need to use the statistics and with the help of some tools like Excel, Python, and Power BI we can actually gain some meaningful information and data from out of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "(v) Visualize the insights-\n",
        "\n",
        "In this step we need to Create the Dashboards and charts and we can create some reports which actually can give us some answers to our questions, and we should use the storytelling from the data to give some meaningful information out of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "(VI) Make Decission out of it-\n",
        "\n",
        "After getting some really meaningful inforamtion and answers of most of the question that was raised, after that we have to make the decission out of it in order to implement it practically.\n",
        "\n",
        "(VII) Monitor and Iterate-\n",
        "\n",
        "After the implementation we need to track the progress of it, in order to check the solution has worked or not.\n",
